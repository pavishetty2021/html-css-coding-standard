# HTML-CSS-Coding-Standard
The main goal is to write well-structured and standards-compliant markup.

# Principles of Standardized Code

   1. Code should be readable and understandable by all members of the team. This includes internal and external developers.
   
   2. All code, regardless of the project, should read as if it was developed by a  single person regardless of how many individuals actually worked on it.
   
   3. The style of writing and implementation of these Code Standards is agreed upon and implemented by the team.
   
   4. Assist in developing well-formed, semantically correct, and mostly valid code.
   
   5. Aid in the onboarding of new development team members to new and existing projects.

      # Code Re-usability:

      Code which shares a very similar or identical structure should be written in such a way that it can be used further.
